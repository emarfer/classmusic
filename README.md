# Classmusic: A Data Engineering Learning Journey

## About This Project

`classmusic` is a hands-on project designed to document and facilitate the process of learning data engineering from the ground up. The primary goal is to gain practical experience by building a complete project, from initial setup to a functional ETL pipeline.

This repository serves as a personal learning log for Ester, a junior data engineer, as she navigates the various stages of a data engineering project.

## Learning Objectives

The main objectives for this project are:

-   Mastering proper Git workflow and repository structure.
-   Understanding and creating reproducible development environments.
-   Building and testing simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines.
-   Applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python.

## Current Status

The project has been initialized with the basic folder structure and configuration files. The next step is to set up the virtual environment for dependency management.

## Project Guidance

The development process is being guided by an AI assistant. The interactions, goals, and mentorship guidelines are documented in the `GEMINI.md` file.
